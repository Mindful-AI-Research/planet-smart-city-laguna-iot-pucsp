## 🌐 [Project Overview]():

<br>

Developed by the **CDIA group at PUC-SP**, this extension project aims to optimize **smart resource management systems** in Smart City Laguna — combining **technology**, **sustainability**, and **community innovation** to empower underserved regions.

With a strong foundation in **interdisciplinary collaboration** and international cooperation, this initiative bridges data science with real-world applications to foster resilient, inclusive, and intelligent cities.

<br>

## [Planet Smart City]():

Founded in 2015 by [**Giovanni Savio**](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e53824a7-19df-464d-a12f-61024ba18a94) and [**Susanna Marchionni**](), Planet Smart City leads the global movement for **affordable, smart, and sustainable housing**. Their projects combine:

- Advanced urban design  
- Integrated technology  
- Community-building initiatives

<br>

## ⚡️ [CDIA Nexus PUC-SP: Innovation Hub for Smart Water and Energy]() 

The **CDIA Nexus** is an initiative by the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Group at **PUC-SP**, dedicated to developing applied **AI and IoT** solutions for **smart water and energy management**.

This innovation hub integrates **applied research, university outreach, and social impact**, focusing on transforming communities through purposeful technology.

The solutions developed are applied in real contexts, such as **Smart City Laguna** (Fortaleza, Brazil), through projects in partnership with organizations like **Planet Smart City**, **UN-Habitat**, **Starlink**, among others.

The project aims to combine **sustainability, digital inclusion, and social innovation**, promoting cities that are more **resilient, efficient, and people-centered**.

<br>

## 💥 [From Code to Insight](): Data Analysis and Decision Support:

<br>

## [Project Goal]():

To develop a data science and AI-based solution to **monitor, forecast, and optimize electricity consumption in a smart home** (Smart City Laguna). The project simulates sensor data per room and uses machine learning to anticipate consumption patterns and propose saving actions.

<br>

## [Dataset](): 

#### ☞ [Tap here]() to access the dataset! 

A **simulated dataset** was used, containing daily records with the following variables:

- `Date`: Day of measurement  
- `KW/H`: Total energy consumption in kWh  
- `Room1`, `Room2`, `LivingRoom`, `Kitchen`, `Pool`: Number of sensor activations per room  
- `SolarGeneration`: Energy generated by solar panels (simulated)

<br>

## [Business Question]():

<br>

> “How can we predict daily energy consumption based on room-specific behavior and, from that, propose automated measures for energy savings and efficiency?”

<br>

## [Methodology and Steps]():

<br>

1.  [***Data import and visualization***]()  

    Reading the spreadsheet using `pandas` and validating formats.


<br>


2. [***Preprocessing***]()  
   
   - Converting the `Date` column to `datetime` format  
   - Creating the `OrdinalDay` variable for modeling  
   - Calculating average consumption per activation per room  
   - Simulating solar generation and projecting future consumption
     

<br>


3. [***Predictive Modeling***]()

   A **Linear Regression** model was trained to estimate consumption (`KW/H`) based on total room activations. It also includes next-day prediction.


<br>


4. [***Visualizations***]() 
   
   - Time series plots with `matplotlib`/`seaborn`  
   - Ranking of rooms with highest consumption  
   - Activation patterns by cluster  
   - Interactive dashboard using Streamlit for real-time monitoring (optional)


<br>


5. [***Report Export***]()  

   Automatic generation of PDF reports with relevant data, charts, and forecasts.


<br>


## [Results]():

- The regression model showed good ability to predict consumption based on room activity  
- **Living Room** and **Kitchen** were identified as the highest impact areas  
- The **Pool**, although rarely activated, had high average consumption per activation — indicating waste; it was removed from the model, since the Laguna project focuses on social housing and does not include pools  
- Solar generation can significantly offset peak-time consumption if properly managed

<br>

## [Conclusions and Recommendations]():

- **Automate power shut-offs** in high-usage areas like the living room and kitchen to achieve immediate savings  
- **Schedule pool usage** to mitigate unnecessary consumption peaks  
- **Leverage solar generation** to balance appliance usage during peak production hours  
- **Implement alerts** when daily consumption targets are exceeded

<br>

## [Deliverables]():

- Streamlit app for real-time sensor monitoring  
- PDF report with consumption metrics and recommendations  
- Notebook containing full data pipeline, predictive model, and visual analyses

<br>

## [Features]():

- Real-time dashboard displaying room-based sensor data  
- Daily energy consumption forecasting via Linear Regression  
- Simulated sensors per room (Room1, Room2, Living Room, Kitchen)  
- Daily consumption target with alert system  
- Auto-refresh system using `streamlit_autorefresh`  
- Usage pattern clustering using KMeans + PCA  
- PDF report export  
- Comparison with simulated solar generation

<br>

## [Technologies Used]():

- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy – data processing and analysis  
- Scikit-learn – linear regression and KMeans  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly – visualizations  
- Streamlit – interactive dashboard  
- FPDF – PDF report generation  
- Pillow – dashboard image rendering

### **[Cell 20: PLOT 11]() - Cluster visualization with PCA**

<br>

### PCA Usage

### We applied PCA demonstratively, even with only two clusters, to show how it works in dimensionality reduction and highlighting important variables.

### Although not essential here, PCA is useful for datasets with many columns or more than two clusters, improving performance and data visualization.


<br>


```python
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
df_plot = pd.DataFrame(X_pca, columns=['Component 1', 'Component 2'])
df_plot['Cluster'] = df['Cluster']
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
for cluster in df_plot['Cluster'].unique():
    plt.scatter(
        df_plot[df_plot['Cluster'] == cluster]['Component 1'],
        df_plot[df_plot['Cluster'] == cluster]['Component 2'],
        label=f'Cluster {cluster}'
    )
plt.title('Cluster Visualization with PCA')
plt.xlabel('Component 1')
plt.ylabel('Component 2')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## 📊 [Interpretation of Graphs and Profiles]():

- **Variable Distribution**: Shows how activations and consumption are distributed.  
- **Temporal Evolution**: Allows identification of consumption trends over the days.  
- **Weekly Activations**: Helps visualize patterns by room.  
- **Correlation**: Shows the strength of the relationship between activations and consumption.  
- **Actual vs Predicted Consumption**: Evaluates the quality of the predictive model.  
- **Clustering**: Identifies groups with similar behavior for personalized recommendations.

<br>

## 💡 [Recommendations by Profile]():

| Profile | Main Recommendations |
| :-- | :-- |
| 🔵 Low Consumption | Maintain good practices, encourage solar energy, rewards/gamification |
| 🟡 Balanced Consumption | Automate shutdowns, install presence sensors, comparative reports |
| 🟠 High Consumption | Automate lights/electronics, specific presence sensors, monitor peaks |
| 🔴 High Consumption (Living Room/Kitchen) | Schedule pump outside peak, conscious lighting use, suggest automation and time-of-use tariff |
| 🔴 High Consumption (Kitchen) | Check equipment, control usage times, encourage lighting efficiency |

<br>

## 🧭 [Conclusion]():

The project enables identifying consumption patterns, forecasting future use, and recommending actions for greater energy efficiency, customizing recommendations according to each residence’s usage profile.

<br>

**Note:**  
Adjust the Excel file path (`file_path`) according to your environment.

<br>

***This analysis was prepared based on data science practices applied to residential energy consumption contexts and aims to facilitate decision-making for the end client.***
